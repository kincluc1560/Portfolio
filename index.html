                Hi! I'm Lucas Kincaid, a student from the Northwestern Coding Program. I've been working with coding since before I was in middle school and I've always loved programming and 
                figuring out solutions to different problems. When I saw a program that could allow me to do what I love as a job I jumped at the chance and I've been having fun ever since!

                The web is full of opinions, and some of these can be negative. Social media allows anyone with an internet connection to say whatever they want about your business. 
                Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
